# Customer Classification with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  

Welcome to the **Customer Classification Project**! This repository demonstrates how the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm can be applied to classify customers based on their attributes. Dive in to see how machine learning can help businesses make data-driven decisions by categorizing customer behavior effectively.  

## 📌 Highlights  
- **Data Preprocessing:** Ensures data is clean and standardized for better model accuracy.  
- **Model Training & Optimization:** Tests multiple \(k\)-values to find the most suitable KNN model.  
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Evaluates train and test accuracy to measure model performance.  
- **Visualization:** Provides insights into the impact of varying \(k\)-values on accuracy.

## 🚀 Features  
### 🔍 **Exploratory Data Analysis**  
- Understands customer data with descriptive statistics and visualizations.  

### 🤖 **Machine Learning Workflow**  
- Trains a KNN classifier using `scikit-learn` for customer segmentation.  
- Tunes the number of neighbors (\(k\)) to optimize performance.  

### 📊 **Evaluation**  
- Compares model accuracy for training and test datasets.  
- Highlights overfitting/underfitting trends.
